### The Genesis of the Project: TRON Ecosystem as a Safe Crowdfunding System

First, we want to gain position as Super Representative Candidate to receive rewards in the TRON Ecosystem and fund the basis of the project with a passive income, while sharing rewards with their voters (sponsors).

### Decentralized Financing (DeFI) and Blockchain Technology for Funding Science

Pharmaceutical corporations, Universities and Institutes, centralize resources to finance research, directing their objectives towards personal ends and profit. Using DeFi and DApps to create investment towards free and autonomous scientific research that really benefits society.

### Decentralized Science (DeSci) Foundation

We want to start a movement for decentralization of science funding, counterbalancing the profit interests of Big Pharma Corporations, making free science that really benefits the end user: Vulnerable People.

### Innovation and Taking Care of Vulnerable People: What have we learned from the pandemic?

If science funding remains controlled by central government, its benefits will come at a high cost for poor countries and their people.  
The unfair commercialization of medicines and vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic is a living lesson in this regard.
